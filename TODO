- Generate symlinks from the "original" squarespace URL paths to the current URLs. This can be done just by literally symlinking them in the content tree.

Ex:

http://www.rocket.ly/home/2010/7/28/the-death-ray-and-the-lean-startup.html

no longer has the date in the URL.

- Configure server to look for ".html" files when there is no extension (Apache does that by default)

- Make sure everything gets stamped with the right caching headers.
